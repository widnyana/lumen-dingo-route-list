Lumen Dingo Route List
======================

[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/widnyana/lumen-dingo-routes-list/v/stable)](https://packagist.org/packages/widnyana/lumen-dingo-routes-list) [![Monthly Downloads](https://poser.pugx.org/widnyana/lumen-dingo-routes-list/d/monthly)](https://packagist.org/packages/widnyana/lumen-dingo-routes-list)

This code bring Dingo's `api:route` command to Lumen's `artisan`.

## Howto
Acquire the source code:
```
composer require widnyana/lumen-dingo-routes-list
```

and Register the service provider:
```
// file: bootstrap/app.php
$app->register(Widnyana\LDRoutesList\CommandServiceProvider::class);
```

call it like this:
```
$ ./artisan api:list-route 
```
for avoiding any command conflict with Dingo nor Lumen, the command is located at `api:list-route `.

### Help wanted

There is an "*undefined behaviour*" that I can't exactly tell you why it will always say `GET|HEAD` for the `Method` columns no matter what HTTP Method you define for each route, as far as I try, there is no HTTP Method passed down to `Dingo\Api\Routing\Route`, and the function call to `$route->getMethods()` will always return `GET|HEAD`. If you know how, please send me a pull request :)
